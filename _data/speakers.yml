      title: 'Resurrecting the dead'
      abstract: |
        Have you ever considered what would happen when a popular open source package is abandoned?
        Now, what about when that package is one of your essential dependencies?
        
        This scenario is not some abstract scenario for a far away future. Projects get abandoned every day and your dependency might be next... But you can help!
        Come & listen to some tales of an accidental maintainer and learn about what you can do to help try and prevent these situations from getting out of hand.

    talk:
      title: 'A journey from Monolith to Modulith to Microservices and back'
      abstract: |
        Building a modular architecture for sustainable growth is a challenge for every successful business. In recent years, Microservices have reigned supreme in architectural discourse and are presented as the holy grail of Software Architecture. However, implementing Microservices the right way comes with a lot of challenges and complexity.
        
        This talk will show off a Modulith approach and show how this concept can be applied to tackle those challenges and help you to make a smoother transition towards Microservices.
        
        And maybe, just maybe, you won't have to take the last step and thus avoid unnecessary complexity.

      title: 'How to write unmaintainable code'
      abstract:
        How do I write code that is as "good" as possible? What does that even mean? I have been working on large open source frameworks (initially TYPO3, now Neos and Flow) for around 20 years. In that time, I have produced a lot of code that I would never write in the same way today - and from which we can learn a lot together. I will critically discuss principles such as extensibility and DRY, show what mistakes I have made when developing frameworks and show which principles we can use to gradually improve our code. The whole thing will be a joint journey into large codebases. I'm looking forward to it!

      title: 'So you think you know PHPUnit'
      abstract: |
        PHPUnit has been around for over two decades and is used by nearly every PHP developer in the world. While most of us know the basics, there are depths and hidden valleys of PHPUnit that even the most experienced of us may have never even heard of.
        
        Join Sebastian Bergmann, the creator and maintainer of PHPUnit, to dig into the hidden depths of lesser known features to get more out of the amazing tool you use every day.

    talk:
      title: 'Running PHP-Applications in a Multi-Process Container'
      abstract: |
        The deployment scenario for PHP looks a little different than for other languages like Go or Ruby that have embedded webservers. The classic stack of NGINX/Apache + php-fpm doesn't perfectly fit in the container world.
        
        Some solution providers, like DigitalOcean or certain Azure products, only allow for single containers to be deployed.
        
        In this talk, we'll explore ways other people have solved this, like FrankenPHP, Framework-X , and others. For production deployments, there is k8s, swarm, compose, and running everything in one multiprocess container.
        
        These single containers could be orchestrated with systemd, supervisord, or Runit. We'll talk about the benefits and downsides of these solutions, compare them with the choice we made for our last project, s6-overlay, show off the s6-cli project I developed for this purpose and talk about recipes for running database migrations, cronjobs and a few more.

    talk:
      title: 'How to build sustainable web applications'
      abstract: |
        Software that is built with sustainability in mind not only has a lower carbon footprint, but it is usually more performant, cheaper to operate and robust. Quite some benefits you won't miss for sure.
        
        But where to start? How do we even measure the emissions of software? And how can we possibly reduce them?
        
        In this talk, we'll explore the latest tools and methodologies that help us to write software which not only makes your users happier, but also stresses the environment a little less.
